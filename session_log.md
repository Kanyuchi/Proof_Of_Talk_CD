## 2026-03-07 14:00 — Initial scaffold: FastAPI backend + React frontend

- Created `backend/` with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic migrations, pgvector
- Created `frontend/` with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- Set up AWS RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Seeded 5 fictional attendee profiles from the XVentures case study

## 2026-03-07 17:30 — 3-stage AI matching pipeline

- Built `backend/app/services/matching.py`: Embed → Retrieve → Rank & Explain
- OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` for attendee profile embeddings (1536-dim)
- pgvector cosine distance (`<=>`) for candidate retrieval
- GPT-4o re-ranking for complementarity, deal-readiness, non-obvious connections
- MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 0.60 threshold to filter weak matches

## 2026-03-08 10:00 — Role-based UI and admin-gated Attendees page

- Attendees list page gated to `is_admin` role — attendees can browse profiles, admin read-only on matches
- Role-based nav: different items shown depending on user role
- Attendee matches marked private — non-admin only sees their own matches

## 2026-03-08 15:00 — In-app messaging and scheduled appointments

- Enabled threaded in-app messages for mutual matches
- Added "Your Schedule" timeline in MyMatches showing booked meetings in chronological order

## 2026-03-09 11:00 — Fixes: messaging empty state, URL validation, mobile

- Fixed messages empty state to explain mutual-accept requirement with shortcut to matches
- Added URL validation with auto `https://` prepend on blur (Register + profile edit)
- Mobile pass: `min-h-[44px]` touch targets, responsive grid layouts

## 2026-03-10 09:00 — Iter-13: intro messages, Extasy sync, photo pipeline, POT brand

- Intro message (icebreaker) auto-send on match accept
- Extasy daily sync wired; daily match refresh cron at 02:00 UTC
- AttendeeAvatar component: fallback chain explicit → Gravatar → Clearbit → initials
- POT brand design: `#E76315` orange, `#0d0d1a` dark, heading font, badge components
- Replaced `window.prompt()` decline with inline textarea panel — no native prompts

## 2026-03-10 16:00 — Fix: meeting scheduling and success/failure states

- Meeting scheduler: slot picker for June 2–3, ICS `.ics` download
- Success/failure states added to all async actions (accept, schedule, feedback)
- "Accept Meeting" / "Not Now" language in place at this point

## 2026-03-11 12:00 — Extasy live pipeline: 16 real attendees ingested

- Created `backend/scripts/pipeline_live.py`: fetches Extasy paid attendees → REST → enrichment → matching
- 16 real attendees loaded into RDS (23 total including 7 seed profiles)
- Hit OpenAI quota limit (429) on EC2 — enrichment/embedding/match-gen blocked; requires top-up

## 2026-03-16 14:30 — Feedback sprint: language, action model, email, shortlist, registration

- **AttendeeMatches.tsx**: `"WHY YOU SHOULD MEET"` → `"Why this meeting matters"` — consistent language
- **AttendeeMatches.tsx + MyMatches.tsx**: `"Accept Meeting"` / `"Not Now"` → full-width filled `bg-emerald-500` "I'd like to meet" as dominant CTA; `"Maybe later"` demoted to plain text link — removes equal-weight button competition
- **MyMatches.tsx**: Added bookmark/save per match card; `All` / `Saved (n)` tab filter; state persists in `localStorage` under `pot_saved_matches`
- **AttendeeAvatar.tsx**: Replaced deprecated Clearbit (`logo.clearbit.com`) with `ui-avatars.com` — always renders styled POT-branded initials, no dependency on external logo API
- **Register.tsx**: Collapsed 3-step wizard (9 fields) → 1-step form (email, password, name, LinkedIn URL, goals) — removed company, title, company_website, seeking, interests, confirmPassword
- **AuthContext.tsx + client.ts**: `RegisterData` fields company/title/ticket_type/interests/goals made optional to match new form
- **backend/app/services/email.py** (new): AWS SES email service — `send_match_intro_email`, `send_mutual_match_email`, `send_meeting_confirmation_email`; fire-and-forget, silent no-op if `AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL` not set
- **backend/app/core/config.py**: Added `AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL: str = ""`
- **backend/app/services/matching.py**: Hooked match intro email at end of `generate_matches_for_attendee`
- **backend/app/api/routes/matches.py**: Mutual match email on `status → accepted`; meeting confirmation email on `PATCH /schedule`
- **backend/app/schemas/auth.py**: `company`, `title` default `""`, `no_empty_strings` scoped to `name` only
- Deployed to green EC2 (3.239.218.239); TypeScript clean, Python syntax clean, migrations ran, service healthy

## 2026-03-16 16:15 — Extasy sync verified, enrichment confirmed, pipeline default updated to green

- Ran `pipeline_live.py --dry-run`: Extasy now has 21 paid attendees (up from 16 last run); all 21 already in DB (total 34 — 21 Extasy + 7 seed + 6 other)
- Both blue (54.89.55.202) and green (3.239.218.239) share the same RDS — data is identical on both servers
- Verified directly on EC2: 34/34 attendees have embeddings + AI summaries; 121 matches at avg score 0.69; enrichment fully functional
- 504 errors seen via pipeline script are nginx proxy timeouts on long-running batch HTTP calls — operations complete on EC2, nginx drops the connection first; not an enrichment failure
- Updated `pipeline_live.py` default target from blue → green (`http://3.239.218.239`); added `"blue"` as named target

## 2026-03-17 15:35 — Netlify production domain + SES activation + green EC2 503 fix

- **Context**: Manager deployed frontend to Netlify at `https://meet.proofoftalk.io` with Supabase DB; green EC2 (3.239.218.239) is the backend; `netlify.toml` proxies `/api/*` → green EC2
- **Root cause of 503 on /attendees**: FastAPI trailing-slash redirect (`307 Location: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/attendees/`) — Netlify proxy couldn't follow a redirect pointing to localhost → 503
- **Fix**: Added `proxy_redirect http://127.0.0.1:8000/ /;` to nginx — rewrites Location to relative path; Netlify can now follow the redirect
- **Green EC2 .env updated**: Added `https://meet.proofoftalk.io` to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; set `APP_PUBLIC_URL=https://meet.proofoftalk.io`
- **SES activation**: `APP_PUBLIC_URL` made an env var in `config.py` (was hardcoded EC2 IP); all 3 email functions default to `settings.APP_PUBLIC_URL`; `.env.example` updated
- **`netlify.toml`**: Confirmed correct — proxies `/api/*` → `http://3.239.218.239`; SPA fallback in place
- **whats_next.md**: Item #8 GDPR decision consolidated in Done ✓; item #19 transparency cues added to Soon
- Deployed latest code to green EC2; nginx reloaded; service healthy

## 2026-03-17 16:05 — Fix Netlify 503: attendees route trailing-slash redirect

- **Root cause**: FastAPI routes defined as `"/"` trigger a 307 redirect to `<scheme>://<host>/api/v1/attendees/`; nginx `proxy_redirect` could not rewrite it because FastAPI uses the `Host` header (`3.239.218.239`) to build the URL, not `localhost:8000`; Netlify passed the 307 to the browser which blocked `http://3.239.218.239/...` as mixed content → original 503
- **Fix**: Changed `@router.get("/")` and `@router.post("/")` in `attendees.py` to `""` — no redirect is issued; endpoint responds directly to `/api/v1/attendees`
- **Also cleaned**: removed unused `proxy_redirect` directive from `deploy/nginx.conf`
- **Verified**: `https://meet.proofoftalk.io/api/v1/attendees` now returns 401 (correct — needs auth token); 503 gone

## 2026-03-20 — Friday weekly update email

- Created `docs/friday-update-2026-03-20.md` — weekly update for team covering 2026-03-17 → 2026-03-20
- Content: production domain live, Supabase sync complete, 1000minds verticals shipped, comp tickets included, 503 fix
- Numbers: 38 attendees, 129 matches, 100% enrichment, 9/11 verticals represented
- Feedback asks: vertical accuracy, Extasy order count confirmation, vertical visibility decision, priority call on verticals vs onboarding

## 2026-03-20 — Progress Report iter-14

- Created `Matchmaking_Feedback/feedback-progress-report-iter14.html` — updated progress report matching iter-13 format
- Generated `Matchmaking_Feedback/POT_Matchmaker_Progress_Report_iter14.pdf` via Chrome headless
- Changes from iter-13: #14 Pending→Partial (SES email), #16 Pending→Partial (SES templates), #19 Pending→Done (saved shortlist)
- Nice to Have: 2.5/8 (31%) → 4.5/8 (56%); Overall: 79% → 84%
- Added "What Changed" section, "By the Numbers" block, 4 new Beyond the Brief items (production domain, Supabase sync, 1000minds verticals, comp ticket pipeline)

## 2026-03-20 — Matching engine enhancement + AI concierge markdown rendering

- **embeddings.py**: Added `vertical_tags` and `intent_tags` to `build_composite_text()` — these signals were classified for all 38 attendees but never fed into embeddings
- **matching.py**: Added `COMPLEMENTARY_VERTICALS` map (11 verticals with cross-sector affinities), vertical_tags in GPT-4o ranking prompt (both target + candidate descriptions), cross-sector instruction, and vertical affinity boost in `_deterministic_rerank()` (+0.04 complementary, +0.02 same-sector)
- **concierge.py**: Added vertical_tags to `_brief_attendee_line()` context, markdown formatting instructions to system prompt, vertical_tags to sector filter in `_apply_tool_filters()`
- **ChatPanel.tsx**: Replaced raw `{msg.content}` with `<MarkdownMessage>` component for styled markdown rendering
- **MarkdownMessage.tsx**: New component — renders assistant messages with react-markdown; styled bold, headers, lists matching POT brand
- Installed `react-markdown` dependency
- Frontend build verified clean
- **Deployed**: backend to green EC2 (`3.239.218.239`), frontend auto-deployed to Netlify (site `gregarious-kitsune-d44915`)
- **Re-embedded**: nulled all 38 embeddings, re-ran `process_all_attendees()` — embeddings now include vertical_tags + intent_tags
- **Re-matched**: `run_matching_pipeline()` produced 140 matches (was 129), avg score 0.700 (was 0.69), 36 above 0.75; 103 complementary, 19 non_obvious, 18 deal_ready
- **Supabase synced**: cleared old 129 matches, inserted 140 new matches via REST API (3 batches of 50/50/40)
- **Smoke tested**: health check OK, registration works, concierge returns markdown-formatted response (### headers, **bold** names, numbered lists), matches endpoint returns results, frontend serves react-markdown bundle
- **SES email blocked**: IAM user `Proof_Of_Talk` lacks `ses:*` permissions — needs `AmazonSESFullAccess` policy attached + sender email verified in AWS Console (cannot do from CLI)
